# Dev-Connector
The social network created using MERN Stack. 
Made so that the developers can connect with each other and share their work. 
Considering the fact that this web app is made by a single developer, it's quite big and has 
many functionalities of a classic social network. 


This app is deployed to Heroku as well but it's still unstable and not ready for testing yet.
